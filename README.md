### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I want to make Apple silicon faster at scientific computing outside the field of AI/ML. To this end, I boosted molecular dynamics performance tenfold using [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) for GPU acceleration. I'm working to enable the simulation of [vastly larger nanosystems](https://github.com/philipturner/molecular-renderer) than previously possible on accessible hardware. The end goal is to contribute to the bootstrapping of [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology) - the final frontier in computer engineering and medicine. This tech could jump decades ahead in Moore's Law scaling, instantly reaching the physical limits of miniaturization and power efficiency.

âš¡ Two years ago, I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first spatial computing experiences accessible to the average person. It is like [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro), but 700x cheaper and available today. The project used LiDAR to [reconstruct reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in three dimensions and used GPGPU to minimize power consumption.

âš¡ I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can also try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) with the power of augmented reality.

ðŸ“˜ I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!

ðŸ“˜ I occasionally publish research papers on GitHub. They are enumerated in the dropdown below:
