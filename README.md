### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently optimizing two modern computational chemistry packages for the Apple GPU, in preparation for a years-long deep dive into nanotechnology. GROMACS and AlphaFold 2 will be crucial to rapidly prototyping and simulating cheap, high-performance nanoscale computers.

ðŸ”­ I'm also [porting Nanite](https://github.com/philipturner/ue5-nanite-macos) from Unreal Engine 5 to Apple platforms. This effort may conclude with optimizing several UE5 features for Metal 3.

<!--
ðŸ”­ I'm currently exploring some fun projects with the Apple GPU:
- Researching GPU-accelerated JSON parsing, as an evolution of [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson).
- [Bringing Nanite](https://github.com/philipturner/ue5-nanite-macos) from Unreal Engine 5 to macOS.
- Adding a Metal backend [to hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL/issues/460).

âš¡ I brought back [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) and the [Swift Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter), then worked on transforming S4TF into a universal platform for GPU-accelerated machine learning. For an overview of this effort, check out [s4tf-subprojects](https://github.com/philipturner/s4tf-subprojects).

âš¡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included research into [reconstructing reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in VR with constrained processing power.

âš¡ I made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can even try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) through the power of augmented reality.

ðŸ“˜ I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!
