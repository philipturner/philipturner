🔭 I want to make Apple silicon viable for scientific computing outside the sub-field of AI/ML. To this end, I boosted molecular dynamics performance tenfold using [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) for GPU acceleration. The next project is the other half of computational chemistry, [quantum chemistry](https://github.com/philipturner/amx-benchmarks). These projects enable the simulation of vastly larger nanosystems than previously possible on accessible hardware. The end goal is to contribute to the bootstrapping of [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology) - the final frontier in computer engineering and medicine. This tech could jump decades ahead in Moore's Law scaling, instantly reaching the physical limits of miniaturization and power efficiency.

⚡ I [reverse-engineered](https://github.com/philipturner/metal-benchmarks) the M1 GPU, explored [high-performance FP64 emulation](https://github.com/philipturner/metal-float64), and scoped out a Metal backend for [Open SYCL](https://github.com/OpenSYCL/OpenSYCL).

⚡ I contributed to the ongoing effort to [port Nanite](https://github.com/philipturner/ue5-nanite-macos) from Unreal Engine 5 to Apple platforms.

⚡ I brought back the [Swift Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) and temporarily [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), then experimented with transforming S4TF into a cross-platform GPU-accelerated machine learning API.

⚡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included research into [reconstructing reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in VR with constrained processing power.

⚡ I made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can also try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) through the power of augmented reality.

📘 I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!
