### Hi there 👋

🔭 I recently [reverse-engineered](https://github.com/philipturner/metal-benchmarks) the M1 GPU. I'm now working on [optimized FP64 emulation](https://github.com/philipturner/metal-float64) and a SYCL backend. The end goal is to make Apple GPUs viable for scientific/high-performance computing (outside the sub-field of AI/ML).

⚡ I contributed to the ongoing effort to [port Nanite](https://github.com/philipturner/ue5-nanite-macos) from Unreal Engine 5 to Apple platforms.

⚡ I brought back the [Swift Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) and (temporarily) [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), then tried to transform S4TF into a universal platform for GPU-accelerated machine learning.

⚡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included research into [reconstructing reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in VR with constrained processing power.

⚡ I made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can also try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) through the power of augmented reality.

📘 I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!
