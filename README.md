### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I've enabled the design of [vastly larger nanosystems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC34BQt2ODM) than previously possible on accessible hardware. The end goal is assisting in the bootstrapping of [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology) - the final frontier in computer engineering and medicine. This technology could reach the physical limits of miniaturization and power efficiency.

ðŸ“˜ I occasionally publish research papers on GitHub. I upload these and other educational documents to the Internet Archive. That way, they will always be available for free.
