### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ Two years ago, I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first <b>spatial computing</b> experiences accessible to the average person. It is like [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro), but 700x cheaper and available today. The project used LiDAR to [reconstruct reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in three dimensions (rather than 2D) and used GPGPU to minimize power consumption.

ðŸ”­ I want to make Apple silicon faster at scientific computing outside the field of AI/ML. To this end, I boosted molecular dynamics performance tenfold using [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) for GPU acceleration. I'm working to enable the simulation of [vastly larger nanosystems](https://github.com/philipturner/molecular-renderer) than previously possible on accessible hardware. The end goal is to contribute to the bootstrapping of [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology) - the final frontier in computer engineering and medicine. This tech could jump decades ahead in Moore's Law scaling, instantly reaching the physical limits of miniaturization and power efficiency.

âš¡ I [reverse-engineered](https://github.com/philipturner/metal-benchmarks) the M1 GPU, explored [high-performance FP64 emulation](https://github.com/philipturner/metal-float64), and scoped out a Metal backend for [Open SYCL](https://github.com/OpenSYCL/OpenSYCL).

âš¡ I contributed to the ongoing effort to [port Nanite](https://github.com/philipturner/ue5-nanite-macos) from Unreal Engine 5 to Apple platforms.

âš¡ I brought back the [Swift Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) and temporarily [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), then experimented with transforming S4TF into a cross-platform GPU-accelerated machine learning API.

âš¡ I made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can also try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) through the power of augmented reality.

ðŸ“˜ I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!

ðŸ“˜ I occasionally publish research papers on GitHub. They are enumerated in the dropdown below:
