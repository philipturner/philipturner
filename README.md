### Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm currently bringing back [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), transforming it into a universal platform for GPU-accelerated machine learning. Development continues in a new repository, [s4tf/s4tf](https://github.com/s4tf/s4tf).

⚡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included [unprecedented research](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) into reconstructing reality in VR, with extremely constrained processing power.

⚡ I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can even try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) using the power of augmented reality.
