### Hi there 👋

🔭 I want to make Apple silicon faster at scientific computing outside the field of AI/ML. To this end, I boosted molecular dynamics performance tenfold using [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) for GPU acceleration. I'm working to enable the simulation of [vastly larger nanosystems](https://github.com/philipturner/molecular-renderer) than previously possible on accessible hardware. The end goal is to contribute to the bootstrapping of [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology) - the final frontier in computer engineering and medicine. This tech could jump decades ahead in Moore's Law scaling, instantly reaching the physical limits of miniaturization and power efficiency.

⚡ Two years ago, I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first spatial computing experiences accessible to the average person. It is like [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro), but 700x cheaper and available today. The project used LiDAR to [reconstruct reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in three dimensions and used GPGPU to minimize power consumption.

⚡ I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can also try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) with the power of augmented reality.

📘 I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!

📘 I occasionally publish research papers on GitHub. They are enumerated in the dropdown below:
