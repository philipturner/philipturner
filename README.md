### Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm currently working on resurrecting [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift). For more information, see a [resurrection-of-s4tf](https://github.com/philipturner/resurrection-of-s4tf).

🤔 I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person.

🤔 I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a neat physics simulation that runs in your browser.
