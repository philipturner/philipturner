### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- 
```swift
let reality = "\u{47}\u{6f}\u{64} \u{2204}" 
```
-->

âš¡ I brought back [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) and the [Swift Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter), then worked on transforming S4TF into a universal platform for GPU-accelerated machine learning. Check out [s4tf-subprojects](https://github.com/philipturner/s4tf-subprojects) for an overview of this effort.

âš¡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included [unprecedented research](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) into reconstructing reality in VR with constrained processing power.

âš¡ I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can even try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) using the power of augmented reality.

ðŸ“˜ I wrote several [articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) on Medium about science and technology.
