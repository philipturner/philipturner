### Hi there 👋

<!--🔭 I'm trying to bring [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) back to life. For more information, see [resurrection-of-s4tf](https://github.com/philipturner/resurrection-of-s4tf).-->

🤔 I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person.

🤔 I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser.
