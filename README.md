### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently bringing back [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), transforming it into a universal platform for GPU-accelerated machine learning. Development continues in a new repository, [s4tf/s4tf](https://github.com/s4tf/s4tf).

âš¡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included [unprecedented research](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) into reconstructing reality in VR with constrained processing power.

âš¡ I also made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can even try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) using the power of augmented reality.

ðŸ“˜ I post articles on Medium about science and technology. They are located at [medium.com/@philipturnerAR](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR).
