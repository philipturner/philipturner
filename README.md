### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently optimizing GROMACS for the Apple GPU, in preparation for research into nanotechnology.

âš¡ I recently worked on [porting Nanite](https://github.com/philipturner/ue5-nanite-macos) from Unreal Engine 5 to Apple platforms. This effort may conclude with optimizing several UE5 features for Metal 3.

âš¡ I brought back the [Swift Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) and (temporarily) [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), then worked on transforming S4TF into a universal platform for GPU-accelerated machine learning. For an overview of this effort, check out [s4tf-subprojects](https://github.com/philipturner/s4tf-subprojects).

âš¡ I created [ARHeadsetKit](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit), which brought the first AR headset experiences accessible to the average person. This included research into [reconstructing reality](https://github.com/philipturner/scene-color-reconstruction) in VR with constrained processing power.

âš¡ I made [MultiPendulum](https://github.com/philipturner/multipendulum), a mesmerizing physics simulation that runs in your browser. You can even try it [in the real world](https://github.com/philipturner/ar-multipendulum) through the power of augmented reality.

ðŸ“˜ I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@philipturnerAR) about science and technology. This is one of my hobbies that isn't programming!
